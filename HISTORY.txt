v4.5
====

2023-01-10  v4.5  Rename rpi_clock.cfg to sample_config.txt.  Update preparation_notes.txt.

2022-12-31  v4.4  Issue #14
* Change default value of SLEEP_TIME_MSEC from 60000 to 3000.

2022-12-06  v4.3  Issue #12
* Stop hard-coding the log output directory as /home/pi.  Its amazing that this was not reported before! 

2019-06-20  v4.2  Issue #6
* I missed a spot in the preparation notes after I externalized all of the configuration parameters out of rpi_clock.py and into a new file, rpi_clock.cfg (v3).  The file rpi_clock_parameters.py is a class defining the parameters so they can be accessed by rpi_clock.py.
* In Python 3 versions earlier than 3.5, this exception occurs: 
AttributeError: type object 'Path' has no attribute 'home'.
I modified rpi_clock.py to support the older versions as well as the current version.

2019-03-07  v4.1
* Validate temperature units configuration parameter (TEMP_UNITS).  Accept entries in any case but the values in lower case must be metric, imperial, or kelvin.
* Display temperature units to the right of current value: C (Metric/Celsius), F (Imperial/Farenheit), or K (Kelvin).

2019-03-06  v4
* Locked out of the Weather Underground!  Huh?!  To make a long story short, they are being absorbed by a more commercial
  enterprise, The Weather Channel ("TWC" on USA cable and many app-oriented boxes).
* Migrated from the Weather Underground to Open Weather Maps.
* All of the operational files in subdirectory `bin` are affected.

2019-01-23  v3
* Pulled out configuration parameters from rpi_clock.py into an external file, rpi_clock.cfg.
* Updated preparation_notes.txt to indicate the changed last line to $HOME/.profile (needs 1 parameter).
* Explicitly close and set to None the url_handle when a network error is encountered.
* Reorganised code.
* Introduced an optional windowed execution.
* Introduced an operator Quit to parent shell function.

2018-05-07  v2
On Linux, if you've recently had a system update, the pi user might see a zenity dialog that covers up the RPi Clock display.  
Instructions for modifying the user pi .profile has been added to rpi_clock/docs/preparation_notes.txt so that 
any such zenity dialogs are automatically signaled to close.
